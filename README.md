# PyQt5 Widget test and showoff program

This program, developed by me, scp, is a program which includes and shows most of PyQt5's widgets.

PyQt5 (PyQt) is a library used for making programs in Python.

To use this program, install a code editor like Visual Studio Code,
install Python from https://python.org, and run `pip install pyqt5` in your program or console.

You can then copy and paste the code here and run it.
